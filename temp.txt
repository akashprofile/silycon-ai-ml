Hello Juniors,

As we all know, many of you are facing difficulty keeping up with the basics, so we’ve designed a small 2-week task module to help you cover essential concepts and assess your involvement.

These tasks are easy but important, and completing them sincerely will help determine who continues as an active member in the club.

 Instructions:
1. Complete all tasks listed below.

2. Upload your code and notebooks on GitHub.

3. Submit your GitHub repo link via a Google Form (link will be shared soon).

4. Deadline: 2 weeks from today.

5. Work hard and be honest—this is your assessment.


*TASK1*
*Python + NumPy + Pandas + Matplotlib Basics*

Dataset: student_performance.csv
Subtasks:
1. Load the dataset using pandas.

2. Calculate the following:

3. Total number of students

4. Students who studied > 2 hours

5. Students who passed

6. Students who studied > 2 hours and passed

7. Percentage of students who passed among those who studied > 2 hours

8. Use Bayes Theorem to compute:
➤ Probability that a student studied > 2h given they passed



*TASK2*
Use Google Colab.
Import any public Kaggle dataset of your choice.

Perform EDA using:
➤ pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn

Summarize the dataset and determine:
Whether it is supervised or unsupervised learning
Which type of algorithm (e.g., classification, regression, clustering) is best suited and why


*TASK 3*

Part A:
Take a basic dataset (e.g., house prices, student scores, etc.)
Apply Linear Regression using scikit-learn
Plot the regression line and calculate Mean Squared Error

Part B:
Augment your dataset by adding noise or generating synthetic data
Re-train your model on the augmented dataset
Compare the performance before and after augmentation


These tasks are simple but meant to test your understanding, consistency, and dedication.

Let’s work hard and make this learning journey count. All the best!
